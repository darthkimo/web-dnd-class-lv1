    <p>In 1981, party clown Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in Gotham
      City. Gotham is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving segments of the
      population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from a disorder
      that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times, and depends on social
      services for medication. After a gang attacks him in an alley, Arthur's
      co-worker, Randall, lends him a gun. Arthur invites his neighbor, single
      mother Sophie, to his stand-up comedy show, and they begin dating.
