  <h1>Setting a Baseline Grid</h1>
  <p>
    <quote>&quotIn a badly designed book, the letters mill and stand like starving
      horses in a field. In a book designed by rote, they sit like stale bread and
      mutton on the page. In a well-made book, where designer, compositor and
      printer have all done their jobs, no matter how many thousands of lines and
      pages, the letters are alive. They dance in their seats. Sometimes they rise
      and dance in the margins and aisles.&quot
