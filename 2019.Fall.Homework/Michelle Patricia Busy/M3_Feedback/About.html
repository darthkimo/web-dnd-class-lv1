        <h4> Autobiography </h4>
        <p> I was a child whose truest form of joy came in a pack of three: the
          road, good music and a genuine company. The earliest memory of art I can
          bring myself to remember is not visual rather it is audible; it was at
          that moment that my soul and entirety came to a focus, that my heart
          beat to the rhythm of the bridge of Bridge Over Troubled Water, that my
          body felt a running electricity, when I first understood the potency of
          art. Today, it's safe to say that my first love is music and
          songwriting. <br>
          <br>
          Months before applying for university, I could not find a subject that I
          would whole-heartedly accept, but the path of discovering the creative
          world reappeared. Upon researching, I came across graphic design. The
          subject was a vague concept to me, but I knew that in some ways, graphic
          design is a means of speaking, much like songwriting. I applied to
          Oregon State University and the Academy of Art. I received a scholarship
          from the former, but my senses told me that if I am going on this
          journey to explore a new purpose, then I might as well submerge in an
          all-around creative environment, San Francisco, the city of artists. I
          know that I want to keep on creating art, but what kept me going was
          that I knew I had to learn about myself. I want to do something that
          matters to me and to other people. Having embarked on a creative journey
          gives me a sense of reassurance that this new corridor of life has
          everything to do with the flow of the universe. I am trying to keep an
          open heart to believe that I will somehow find my voice. <br>
