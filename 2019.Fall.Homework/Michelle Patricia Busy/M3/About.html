            <h4> Autobiography </h4> 
			  <p>  I was a child whose truest form of joy came in a pack of three: the road, good music and a genuine company. The earliest memory of art I can bring myself to remember is not visual rather it is audible; it was at that moment that my soul and entirety came to a focus, that my heart beat to the rhythm of the bridge of Bridge Over Troubled Water, that my body felt a running electricity, when I first understood the potency of art. Today, it's safe to say that my first love is music and songwriting. <br>

			Months before applying for university, I could not find a subject that I would whole-heartedly accept, but the path of discovering the creative world reappeared. Upon researching, I came across graphic design. The subject was a vague concept to me, but I knew that in some ways, graphic design is a means of speaking, much like songwriting. I applied to Oregon State University and the Academy of Art. I received a scholarship from the former, but my senses told me that if I am going on this journey to explore a new purpose, then I might as well submerge in an all-around creative environment, San Francisco, the city of artists. I know that I want to keep on creating art, but what kept me going was that I knew I had to learn about myself. I want to do something that matters to me and to other people. Having embarked on a creative journey gives me a sense of reassurance that this new corridor of life has everything to do with the flow of the universe. I am trying to keep an open heart to believe that I will somehow find my voice. <br>
