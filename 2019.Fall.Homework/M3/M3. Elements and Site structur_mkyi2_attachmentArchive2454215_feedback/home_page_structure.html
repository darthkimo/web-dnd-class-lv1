          My name is Moe Kyi. I am an interior major student currently studying at
          the Academy of Art University.
          <br> I take photos during the free time, trips, and basically everywhere
          at anytime.
          <br> Photographing has allows me to see things from different
          persepctive which inspired me to have a more open mind to the world.
          <br>I loves to be inspired and capture every moment of my life!
