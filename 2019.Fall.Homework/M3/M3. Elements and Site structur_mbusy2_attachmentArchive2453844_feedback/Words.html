        <h4> Artistic philosophy </h4>
        <p> Art reveals itself as a means of reflecting and connecting, hence
          plays an extremely vital role in my life. It does not only serve as a
          canvas of expression, but also a mirror of retrospect. There is a
          healing nature in creating that I cannot find elsewhere; with every
          craft I've created, there is a certain honesty projected onto it. My
          artistic philosophy is simple; it is to continue intrepidly creating -
          there must not be a fear of producing &#34;bad art,&#34; as each draft
          guides the artist closer to achieving the best possible result. My
          creative process in art differs to that in design. In the latter, which
          is also my field of study, I gather as much inspiration as I can. I
          analyze the subject of the design and study past works from notable
          artists and designers, assessing what suits my style and the notion I am
          trying to communicate. I believe that visual literacy makes a huge
          difference in creating meaningful pieces; it satisfies me to put in
          extra effort and thoughts into my designs and attaining a result with
          the quality I intended. My philosophy of creating without fear reflects
          on the way I approach my creative process; experiment and strive to grow
          from the first idea. Trusting the process enough to let go of ideals of
          what exactly the product must look like was previously a challenge for
          me. Nevertheless, it has also become one of the most imperative lessons
          in studying graphic design.
