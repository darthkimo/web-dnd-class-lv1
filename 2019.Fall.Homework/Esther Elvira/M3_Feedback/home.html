<!--
  Please compare this feedback file with your homework.

  What do you do good:
    - Great work on creating the simple site.
    - Nice Job on adding alt information to the image.
  What can be improved:
    - Format your code with consistent spacing, so that you can easily know
      what you are working on and spot any error.
    - All the images were trying to load from static/images/, but I don't see the folder.
      I move all the images to static/images/
    - It will be great to have email contact link in the footer.
    - See other detail feedback below.
